# luci-app-ssr-plus modify version

The Original version only provide main server and netflix rule which can assign a node, it's not so convinent to add more route rules. 

To solve this problem, this project will focus on the following functions. 

## Functions:

- Add specified route rules
- Those rules can be assigned to special node.
- only 3 rules will be added in the initial release.
- more functions will be added if needed.

## Thanks
